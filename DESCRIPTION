Description: Streamlined data import and export by making assumptions that
    the user is probably willing to make. Determines the data structure
    from the file extension, reasonable defaults are used for data import
    and export (e.g., 'stringsAsFactors=FALSE'), web-based import is
    supported (including SSL/HTTPS), some compressed files can be read
    directly without explicit decompression, and fast import packages are
    used where appropriate.
